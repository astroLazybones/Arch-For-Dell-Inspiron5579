(i dont know how well i made this tbh)
ALMOST ALL WAS DONE BY XZRVR <br>
THE GITHUB REPO WAS MADE BY ME SO I COULD REMEMBER THE STEPS <br>
Read knowledge.txt for info that will occasionally be updated <br>
<br>
<br>
First Part: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Arch ISO Creation: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setup.txt <br>
Second Part: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Create Partitions/Boot Loader Configs/Other Stuff: <br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iso.txt <br>
Third Part: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Installing Desktop Enviroment: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DE.txt <br>
<br>
The result will look similar to this:
